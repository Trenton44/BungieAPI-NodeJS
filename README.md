# [*Project GetGlimmer*](https://github.com/Trenton44/BungieAPI-NodeJS)
## ***Goal***
This project aims to give Destiny 2 players a way to easily manage inventory between characters, while keeping a relatively simple interface to interact with. Looking for a weapon in the middle of an activity, only to realize you left it on another character, is both incredibly inconvenient and time-consuming for a player, and this project aims to fix that.

## ***Purpose***
 I started this project with the intention of making something I could add to my portfolio. As I got further into it, however, I started enjoying the experience more. So now, I plan on continuing to work on this project until it can rival a certain [existing item manager](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM) in scope, both for my own learning and because I like the game.
 TLDR: I made this thing, now I'm attached to it.

## ***Bugs and Feature Requests***
if you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Trenton44/BungieAPI-NodeJS/issues/new) on it. If you would like to request a feature, also open an issue, though note I'm a one man army, so I can't promise anything.
